 * \brief Holds all the textures that the Nova Renderer can deal with
 *
 * This class does a few things. I'm going to walk you through a couple usage scenarios because it's way easier for me
 * to explain things that way
 *
 * \par Loading a resource pack:
 * When MC loads a resource pack, the Java Nova code should reset the texture manager. That clears out all existing
 * textures, freeing up the VRAM and RAM they used. Next, the Nova Renderer loops through all the textures it cares
 * about, which is super gross because I have to hardcode the values it cares about but I don't know a better way to do
 * is yet, and gets each texture from the resource pack. It sends each texture to the texture manager by way of
 * nova_renderer#add_texture(mc_atlas_texture). Once all textures have been loaded, the Nova Renderer calls
 * nova_renderer#finalize_textures, which tells the texture manager (this thing) to stitch as many textures as possible
 * into a texture atlas and generate a mapping from texture place in the atlas to texture name, such that someone can
 * call texture_manager#get_texture_location(std::string) and get back a texture_location struct, which has the GL ID
 * of the requested texture, the minimum UV coordinates that refer to that texture, and the maximum UV coordinates that
 * refer to that texture. This is useful mostly when building chunk geometry, so I can assign the right UV coordinates
 * to each triangle.
 *
 * \par Rendering the world:
 * This class won't perform a lot of actions while rendering the world. Mostly I'll just be like "I need the terrain
 * texture" or "I really need the entity texture". I'm going to be using texture atlases as much as possible. Anyway,
 * I'll ask the texture manager for a certain texture atlas, and the texture manager will give it back to me. Then, I
 * can bind that texture and render my pants off.
