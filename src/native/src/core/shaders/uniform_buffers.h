 * \brief Defines a number of UBOs that are sent to shaders
 *
 * I've put them all in one header file so that there's a single place to see all the available uniforms. When this
 * project is a bit closer to release, I'll document this file so that the Doxygen generated documentation will serve
 * as a reference of what uniforms are available through Nova.
